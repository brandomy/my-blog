## Why - my Why?

Yesterday I was talking to Yun Liu in Tianjin (she was in Beijing actually) and we discussed a segment in our Toastmasters club called "Founder's Fire". I added this concept in our last meeting to give one of our members a chance to share in 2-3 mins what inspired him to startup his agri-tech business. His "Why?". 

We felt this is a good idea as it is focused on his business and a bit different from a typical Toastmasters ice-breaker.

Moreover it gives him a chance to try and compress his business concept into 2-3 mins. This is a good exercise.

## My Why

In a nutshell, I believe I am here on earth to connect people. To get to know them so that I can connect them with others whom I know.

And our business - Brandmine? It is my opportunity to get to know founders of brands in Eurasia - and connect them with the resources they need, be it people, partners or capital. It is a lofty ambition but the essence is quite simple - to connect people I know with others. 

This is what I do most naturally. So I would like to do it formally and for years ahead.
